Branches

- The master branch contains a version of the app that runs against Corona.  
- The rest-api-port branch contains a version of the app that has been ported to run against 
  MarkLogic 6 and the rest-api.  Before you build the app in XCode, you need to updated the password
  in the MarkLogic World-Prefix.pch file
 
Server setup for REST API PORT

- Create a database and assign a rest api instance.  Code here is hardcoded to port 8011.
- Pull down the app source code on to the server somewhere and look in the admin directory
- Unzip the data and load via loader.py (needs admin creds on the cmd line)
- Then add speaker names by running the import.xqy script inside QueryConsole or the like.
